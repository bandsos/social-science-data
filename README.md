This repository contains the social science data layers derived under the BandSOS project funded by Space Climate Observatory (SCO).

The `DataDescription.xlsx' contains the descriptions of the headers found for all the geojson layers in `Data/` directory. Inside `Data/` directory, the same layers are provided as polygons (2nd administrative boundary level) in `Data/Polygons` directory, and points (centroid of the 2nd administrative boundary level) in `Data/Points`.

`CombinedData.json` in both `Polygons` and `Points` directory constains the full set of data. In addition, the `Polygons` directory, the data is splitted in domains, as listed in `DataDescription.xlsx`.

The dataset presented here is an updated version of the following work -
